  "description": "The DDLmesh series of high-definition video transmission/data transmission Digital Data Links, between with MANETmesh series of broadband wireless ad hoc networks, use the same software radio platform (936x+7Zxx), modulation and coding of the physical layer waveform, HTDMA of the MAC layer, and RF circuits, to achieve the same wireless transmission performance and technical specifications, including the same: RF output power, receiving sensitivity, transmission rate/transmission distance, anti-jamming of adaptive frequency hopping and intelligent frequency selection, software and hardware encryption, low-latency transmission, local and remote management, and the same volume size and power supply IP level, etc. However, the DDLmesh series of data links simplifies the Mobile Ad-hoc Networking routing protocol of the MESH network, also support dynamic routing and multi-hop relay, and have corresponding linear, mesh, and dynamic hybrid networks, but, in smaller network scale, i.e. less than 8 nodes. In other words, the DDLmesh series of data links supports, point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-multipoint direct communications without central to cross-connection in the same time and space, also mobile ad-hoc networking in smaller network scale of less than 8 nodes. It is very important that the DDLmesh series of data links can be upgraded to the corresponding products of the MANETmesh series of large scall MESH broadband wireless ad hoc networks through authorized software upgrades."
